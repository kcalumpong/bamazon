# WELCOME TO BAMAZON!! 

## How does it work?

## BAMAZON Customer

BAMAZON is an Amazon-like storefront. Customers now have the ability to browse through several items in different departments ranging from Home & Garden to Outdoor & Sports. 


* First, the customer can selects which item they would like to purchase by entering the product's ID number. 

* Next, the customer will be prompted to enter in the amount of items they would like to purchase. The customer will receive their total at the end of the transaction and the store's inventory will be updated in MySQL.

## BAMAZON Manager

With Manager View, the manager is given four different options:

* View Products for Sale: This shows a detailed list of all the products for sale by product name, ID number and price. 

* View Low Inventory: This prompt will bring up a detailed list of all the products that have 5 items or less in stock.

* Add to Inventory: This option gives the manager the ability to add inventory to the database. The manager will select the product to add inventory to by selecting its ID number and the amount of inventory to add.

* Add New Product: This option gives the manager the ability to add a new product to the MySQL database. To add a new product the manager will enter the item name, department, price and quantity on hand.
